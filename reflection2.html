    <h2>AI Slop</h2>
<p>According to the article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” Nesrine Malik discusses the difference between two parallel images, one that is a genuine image and the other that is AI-generated. As she explains, “In one, there are real pictures and footage of the world as it is. In the other is AI slop, low-quality content with minimal human input.” Although AI-generated images are a new problem, Malik makes a good argument that such images are “low-quality content” and that they have “minimal human input.” This lack of quality and low human input is not just about the images themselves, but also about what they represent of the world. I have noticed a few ad videos YouTube that were AI-generated and they offer good examples of what Malik says that AI slop does. In fact, I have run into some videos online that reflected some of the rightwing political fantasy content that Malik identifies as a particular feature of AI slop as a genre, presenting made up scenarios about Trump official againt to so-called “liberal” forces. </p>
<p>In the article, Malik describes what an AI slop is, identifying it as a genre of rightwing political fantasy that involves creating AI-generated images that support a particular political agenda. She also discusses what AI slop does, and how it can be mentally disastrous to people. The reason that it is disastrous, as she explains, is that it leads to exposure to AI images in the first place. The main argument is about what the AI slop spreads out across the internet including chats in the WhatsApp. AI slop also posts images that can be seen as overwhelming, chaotic, and unsafe for people. By drawing attention to this issue, Malik is warning us about we must be careful with AI slop when using social media.</p>
<p>The evidence Malik uses to confirm her main argument about AI slop includes examples about the Chinese AI videos were made by those who do not see any protentional from American workers. These videos obviously reflect political propaganda, and they have little basis in fact. They are easy to make because of AI, though, and the people behind them probably have fewer ethical concerns about creating content like this because the videos do not represent real people.</p>
<p>The details I’ve read from the article are new information for me but already I am more aware of this phenomenon of AI-generated images online. I think this info is very important to learn because it helps us understand Malik’s theory of AI slop causing distort to the viewers. And we must be very careful with what it posts on the WhatsApp and online. As someone who is pretty new to social media, I think it is particularly important for me to be aware of this content.</p>
<p>The biggest problem that Malik identifies, though, is that these AI-generated images and videos are getting increasingly difficult to distinguish from real images, and people who are not aware of AI or not thinking critically about how image and video content are made may unto appreciate how AI is also manipulating their perspective.</p>
