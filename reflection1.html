<h1>Reflection for “On Photography” by Susan Sontag</h1>
<p>In “On Photography,” the essayist and novelist Susan Sontag writes about what it means to collect photographs. She suggests in her introduction that “[t]o collect photographs is to collect the world.” She explains what she means by this later in the essay. She talks about how films and television programs “light up the wall, ficker, and go out,” but that photographs are images that are permanent. She talks about how an image is an “object, lightweight, cheap to produce, easy to carry about, accumulate, and store.” This is a really important idea to maintain about photography because it suggests that there might even be a greater responsibility when it comes to creating photographs. The experience of looking at photographs is also different because you look at them continuously unlike film or television.</p> 
<p>Sontag also discusses how “[t]o photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed.” She explains this further, saying that she means that by taking a photograph a person is putting themselves “into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge – and therefore, like power.” This idea is important for thinking about how you take photographs and the role that you have as a photographer. This might have practical implications for people who want to take pictures. It might have something to do with taking responsibility for getting people’s consent. It suggests, if you have power taking a photograph, that you probably should not take a photograph if you do not have someone’s permission or if they are uncomfortable because you are in a position of power. The other thing that it suggests is that there is a more abstract or artistic dimension to consider when thinking about how you take a photograph. </p>
<p>Related to this idea, Sontag talks about how “[p]hotographs furnish evidence” and also they serve in this capacity like a crime scene. They record things that can be evidence. They are useful tools for surveillance. I watched a film with my mom recently called Denial and that talks about the lack of photographic evidence for the Holocaust as evidence. Sontag describes how “[a] photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happens,” but this is also really before the age of AI, and it sort of assumes that someone can’t make up a fake photograph. The film Denial also, interestingly, features scenes that were filmed on location at Auschwitz concentration camp or what remains of it, and the camera crew had to get specific permission for this because it is considered a shrine.</p>
<p>In my own creative work, I use photography and imagery for my art drawings by capturing the action scenes and objects from my favorite films. I once used imagery to draw a graphic of flowers as a Mother’s Day and birthday gift for my mom last year. When I capture images, they’re either of what I like such as scenes filled with nature or family memories at home. It makes me happy whenever I catch sight of nature during the spring because nature helps me feel calm.</p>
<p>Reading Sontag’s essay got me thinking more about the implications of my photography and what I might do with a camera to be socially responsible, which is something I care about. This essay also got me thinking about how I can use my camera to make a record of things and people that I care about.</p>
